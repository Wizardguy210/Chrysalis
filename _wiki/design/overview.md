# Overview

# Problems with MMOs

Many of the MMOS I play have some deep set problems that could be addressed in a new MMO.

# Economic Woes

By not placing enough money sinks and ways to remove gear from the games they create an inflationary economy that would make Berlin and Argentina feel self confident about their fiscal responsibility. There need to be ways to ensure large sums of gold and goods don't flood the game, and the easiest way is to not give them very much to start with.

For example, in GW2 nothing is worth more than the very low vendor price on it now. Crafting is a massive money sink, drops are usually better off being vendored to avoid the 15% tax on the TP.

I think it is far better to be miserly with the loot so it is appreciated a lot more. I want them to struggle.

# No Impact

The player will often have absolutely no impact on their server. Why kill a world boss or a God if they re-spawn in 4 hours or a few days time?

Killing a dragon should be an event, one that might take a whole village to do along with it's heroes e.g. Smaug in The Hobbit. There must be a way to let all the players feel like they were a part of something big without simply letting them all divide into raids of 20 men  and go into an instance and work at it week after week.

Some bosses should be so hard they are there for years before they are taken out. Something less dull than the resource grind for Sithalus, but with even low levels able to contribute something.

Killing a world boss should be a rare and world changing event. People who do so get a title, maybe a trifling reward, a share of some booty.

# Self Policing

Players should be able to vote kick a player off the server or some lesser punishment like a short ban. After a few warnings bring the banhammer down and ban their account from that server – though they would be free to go to others.

Servers should be able to be set up around policies e.g. an RP server is obvious, but perhaps an RP perma-death one could cater to the small number of players that would enjoy that. They could petition and as long as a minium number (something small) agree, a name could be set and the server spun up.

This could foister smaller communities with set agendas – but beware the deserted server issue. There needs to be a midpoint between NWN and the current massive MMOs.

Jails could be put in use (where are my other notes?)

# The Game Starts At Endgame

This is just bullshit. Having to play though 85 mind-numbingly boring levels of WoW just so I can spend weeks gearing up to catch up with a raid group's minimum gear level to join them then attend a month's worth of raids being handed gear before I can feasibly contribute...bullshit.

The game starts at level 1, and it should provide the ability to immediately group and handle challenging content. You can stay in the starter area if you need a soft tutorial experience or jump straight into the rest of the game.

You should start the game with basic gear and either a basic spell or attack that is highly effective against any mob in game – say no less than 25% (TBD) lower than a tricked out character. You should soon be given a method to either HoT / DoT / or react. Add more abilities as you go – but even if you can only spam that basic attack you should be of some help to a group.

Boss AOE attacks should not just one shot you as a rule – though their charges / etc should.

A pair of new chars of average skill should be able to take out a ganker at the bridge out of noob island i.e. a new char should not as a combined result hit for less, heal for less, and take more dmg than 51%. This might mean they hit for 70% of the damage, heal for 70% and reduce dmg by 70% or something similar. Gankers should only need one or at worst two other players in the new zone to gang up and take them down.

# Tortage

If possible you should give the player the chance to start the game in almost any zone. This might be a zone for their race / class or just the zone of choice...maybe even their guild city.

Don't make them play through Tortage 10 times for 10 alts. The same goes for every area, they should be able to skip areas they don't like – like deserts or spider filled forests.

The tutorial quest might be offered in several zones, but there is no real need since they should only do it the once.

# Other Things I Hate

-    Standard builds – this one for raids, this for PVP – no arcane mages thanks...oh, all go arcane now.
-    Resistance fights – grinding for gear
-    Frost giant fights on a frost mage (multiple builds and skillwheel will help)
-    XP curves – the rewards from lvling become horribly thin as you ride up the steep side of the curve
-    Gear resets
-    Resilience and PVP gear (can't be modded, all looks the same, arbitrary way to stop PVE players from having nice gear that works in PVP too)

# Things I Really Like

-   The combat from AoC and Tera
-   The skill wheel from TSW
-   Resource harvesting from Tera
-   The crafting complexity from Ryzom
-   40 man raids in WoW
-   Mass scale PVP from WoW (AV)
-   Roleplay support
-   Target dummies that show your DPS / HPS and attack you to trigger reactives (small dmg) Maybe test mobs in arenas to fully test DPS under pressure
-   Political system
-   Sandbox features
-   Guild Cities / Halls
-   Player housing
-   Seating that works
-   Gorgeous environments
-   Imaginative monster design and combat
-   Events from Rift
-   Dynamic grouping from Rift
-   BAMs
-   Tutorial
-   GW2 / TSW – limited number of skills at once
-   Multiple builds – Rift / etc
-   TSW – a build is gear and skills
-   Customisation of character looks, even from char creation so we don't all have that shitty loincloth and tatty shirt
-   TSW intro / tutorial – start with just street clothes, try out all the weapons to start off, choose one, just some support items – off to fight the good fight
-   Factionless
-   FFA PVP / GvG / World PVP that isn't ganking or guard humping
-   A well played new character could beat a badly played geared character through skill
-   Low aggro range on mobs – harvesting should not require you to kill everything in a 30 meter radius
-   Allow multiple people to harvest at once...better yields, more stuff all around, removes node ninja practices and fights
-   Should harvesting be a mini-game like Ryzom, or simple like nearly every other game?
-   Stanzas
-   Combos
-   Ability chaining
-   Public quests
-   Guild control of territory
-   Group play of all sizes
-   Duo / trio with friends should always be possible, never punish the players
-   Questing in TSW – clues from real world and environment

# Other Interesting Ideas

Player run mail system – players as either individuals or groups could volunteer to deliver the mail around the world. No mail gets in or out without being carried on a consignment protected either by NPCs (for late night) or groups of PVP active players. If the mail is overrun then perhaps those items and gold and letters could be put into a chest under the guard of the faction that took them.

Attack and win to unlock the chest and get the mail back on the road again. You could either take insurance against robbery for delivery, hire special delivery, etc.

It's effectively a long sort of escort or mini-game of a series of escorts and ambush quests – but still has the possibility of being interesting.

Players knowing a big haul is coming through (rumour from NPC) could plan a heist. Player could have to grind a little faction to start work as a mailman, taking small loads first, then larger ones as he suceeds. Delivery time need not be escort, it could be say 'get this stuff to the next town by 7pm...2 hours' and you get it done as extra work while you quest.

The players with fast horses might be the couries of the country - so long as they don't get taken down by bandits.

Usual public quests – save the town, kill the mobs, escort? Maybe things like harvest lumber, clean a river, provide security for a event NPC or otherwise
Cult quests – unleash a huge world boss on a zone by performing an expensive and complex ritual.

Possible closed loot and gold system – only a certain amount on the server in total. As the 1% accumulate this make them vulnerable to being robbed, blackmailed, etc.

# Things I'd Like to Achieve

The servers should not have a story on rails, each should in fact tell it's own story and this gets written into a sort of storybook for that server. Major events like invasions, felling a ruler of a zone, killing a huge boss, etc would all be written as a few lines or pages in a storybook with perhaps sceenshots and the like.

Guilds might want to overthrow a dictator, others might side with them, giving rise to interesting politics. Said dictator might be imposing huge taxes, murdering citizens, or other onerous things...removing him would remove these impediments, but supporting guilds might benefit from it and so stop others from taking him down.

Siege warfare – everyone wants it, we should get it. It should be meaningful too, and not feel light like WoW's battlegrounds. Will check out GW2 for this.

Voice comms integration with Mumble or similar. Make it simple to get all your group onto a server and in a channel and talking. Highlight which char is speaking – maybe put a nimbus around them. Overlay on HUD shows who's speaking too (can be several).

# Gameplay

I want gameplay to be a seamless movement from questing to PVP, events, exploration, gathering, crafting and all the truly interesting and fun things we do inside these worlds.

There shouldn't be cockblocks to fun like requiring the players to run to a major town every two levels to train a skill – though I do like the way fires work in Tera. A player should be able to enjoy non-stop play without worries that his backpack is now 2000kg of armour, weapons, 'flavour items', wolfs teeth, etc.

Reasonable reasons to go to town are to trade, long-term storage, crafting, socialise, check job notices, visit specialist NPCs, etc.

You should be able to stay in the field for a very long time and then return to town at the end of the night or start of day to relax or perform quieter pastimes.

# Questing

Questing is seriously broken in most the games out today. They need some reform. There should never be a 'kill 10 rats' quest, these can be handled in the field once you kill one rat.

The same for collection quests – again, in the field as the first item drops. Quests should all be special, advance the story, provide rewards beyond mere drops or maybe provide faction – with other faction coming from plain old killing of 1,000,000 mobs.

Quests should be special, allowing the team to develop far less of them, but provide greater value from the ones present.

## Known Quest Types

A list is provided of [quest types](quest-types).

# Interesting Economic Ideas

Vendors have only the most incredibly basic items to sell.

When players sell mats to the vendors or run their quests it opens up access to some items which can be made from those.

Supply might also come from other zones. If supply lines are cut or the zone is unable to produce those items this causes a shortage.
Vendors can sell on consignment for you.

Resources should cycle into each other, becoming less and less to help wash the economy clean.

Highly restrict gold in both use, and acquisition.

Only humanoid mobs should really have gold, others might have nothing or some resource. This could piss off a lot of players who expect they can kill 1000 mobs and end up with 20,000 gold, 270 pieces of armour, etc.

# Resource Control

Resources are generally centred around the largest town that the Iron Town people can build and improve in a region. To prevent one side or the other being steam-rolled the resources closest to their power base will be far harder for the other side to take and control.

Partially this can be through logistics, partly from a bolster mechanic, and maybe even let the hard pressed side field more members for the critical battles. I would rather see a battle go back and forth for months then be resolved in 5 days with one side then resigning while the other milks the situation.

I want the game to focus around strategic fighting, resource management, logistics and leadership. Traps, prepared ground, death ground...the more things we can bring into it the better.

# Resources

These are available all over the entire world, spread somewhat evenly, but positioned to ensure the whole map is worth fighting over. No one region should be far more desirable than every other one.
-    Tin / copper / silver / gold / iron
-    leather / hides / skins / vellum / parchment
-    lumber
-    wheat / barley / corn / oats
-    hemp
-    herbs / mushrooms / bark / roots / vines / berries
# -    flint  / slate / granite / sandstone
-    fish / wild game / birds
-    water

Each side will need what it requires to have shelter, warmth, weapons, rope, food, water. Wildlings will take carefully from nature, humans will seek to take as much as they can.

## Control to Profit

-    Lumber Mill – major control point for harvested lumber.
-    Ore Mine – major control point for ores.
-    Gem Mine
-    Stone Quarry
-    Farms
-    Zone entry points – tax
-    Roads – tax
-    Ocean Trade Routes
-    Ports
-    Shops
-    Religious Places
# -    Control for Military Might
-    Encampment
-    Tower
-    Fortress
-    Palisade

# Crafting

Crafting should take a village to achieve, and be tied to a 'tech tree' like in RTS style games. By taking crafting away from everyone and making it a major undertaking things will have greater value. Guilds will start with nothing, and slowly over time they will begin to harvest the resources they need, as long as they control resource points e.g. mines, fields.

They begin knowing almost nothing about how to create thread, cloth, leather and clothes, etc. Over time they will gain increased skills with materials and head into specialisations that will be highly tradeable.

# Cool Ideas

Player generated content. Every server would be different as major cities are not in place at the start but build by the players. We can template where they can place buildings or give them a 'planning permission' system and let them take care of it themselves. See who builds the tidy city on a grid with wide roads, and who makes the Shambles in London.

Perma-death. Allow a system of flagging for perma-death which could occur while adventuring, in a battle for a keep, or maybe a duel. Hash out rules to enable this.

Federated servers. Allow people to hook into our system and take their characters into other compatible worlds. Allow people to run a home world on their own system which others can visit. Allow them to really customise the crap out of it...using the same tools we use to build worlds.

Filming permit. Ask permission to play as cameras which can perform all the major camera moves. This could allow spying, so limit it to a time and place when 'filming' can occur. Support machinima e.g. 3 camera setup to allow a single take of a scene to be cut into a cinematic view.

Regional control over questing. Provide control system to allow regional or even town owners to place NPCs and script events / quests which anyone can enjoy. This could be a great way to get more quests done quickly. Imagine a town which is run by followers of Thulsa Doom...they could have all sorts of quests that help support their God which you can complete to gain enough rep to join as an acolyte. Imagine applying in game to an interview given in character. Give access to pre-build stock NPCS and quests to kick it off.

Respect / Honour / Loyalty / Karma as currencies. Karma is for actions that have karmic value e.g. a murder, stealing, giving to the poor. The others are difficult to pin down but should be considered along with any other measure of your worth to a community.

PCs as NPCs. A player character can kick off an NPC script which will allow them to be controlled totally as an NPC, including buying and selling, spruiking at a market, handing out quests.

Gods? Mark holy spots around each map where they can place sacred buildings e.g. at first an arrangement of 5/7/12 rocks, a shrine, a temple, etc. Depending on gods you choose to worship gives region bonuses. Polytheism and monotheism supported. Gods can teach very rare recipes or provide other boons including weather.

Weather matters. Crops will fail if rain is not in right range, same with temperature. Because we control the terrain, sky and weather we can cause floods, droughts, even plagues.

Does human sacrifice work? Maybe ;p

# Armour

We will follow a path similar to TSW when it comes to armour in that there will be clothing you can see with no stats. Characters will provide slots for stats / effects which are separate to that. Currently the idea of chakra points being used to hold stats is appealing as it means you can fight naked if you like with no loss of ability; further, the idea that armour holds magical properties is outdated. Chakra points would be weighted, with the higher weightings able to contain a better stat / ability. For example:

-   Head (exclusive)
-   Heart (exclusive)
-   Right / Left Hand (minor)
-   Belly (centre, major)
-   Groin (major)
-   Right / Left Foot (minor)

Characters would learn a few simple chakra settings from a trainer they met early. Chakra can be changed by meditating for a moment or two in full lotus. Over time they would broaden their knowledge of chakras and be able to apply those to their combat.
